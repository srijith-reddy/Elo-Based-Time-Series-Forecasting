# ðŸŽ¾ Elo-Based Time Series Forecasting


An interactive ATP Elo Forecast Dashboard built with Python and Streamlit.  
This app automatically computes advanced surface-aware Elo ratings, constructs monthly time series for every ATP player, and applies a Smart ARIMA Model Selection system to forecast each playerâ€™s Elo trajectory up to 24 months ahead.  
It also visualizes win probabilities, residual diagnostics, and model interpretability plots (ACF/PACF) â€” giving fans, analysts, and researchers a statistical edge in understanding player form trends.

## ðŸ§  Model & Methodology

- **ARIMA Auto-Selection** â€” automated differencing and trend detection with ADF-based stationarity tests.  
- **SmartScore Ranking** â€” custom composite metric combining AIC, BIC, RMSE, and Ljungâ€“Box stability for robust model selection.  
- **Dynamic Elo System** â€” continuously updated surface-adjusted ratings per player (Hard, Clay, Grass, Carpet).  
- **Forecast Horizon:** Configurable from 6 to 24 months.  
- **Diagnostics:** Residual ACF/PACF, Ljungâ€“Box tests, and forecast uncertainty intervals.

### ðŸŽ¯ Win Probability Formula

$$
P(A \text{ beats } B) = \frac{1}{1 + 10^{-\frac{(E_A - E_B)}{400}}}
$$
